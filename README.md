GemFire Developer REST API Prototype
====================================

The GemFire Developer REST API is a general purpose, non-application specific REST API and interface exposing GemFire
as a polyglot application data store and data management platform as well as an interface to make GemFire
more accessible via HTTP from within a cloud context (CloudFoundry, EC2).

The prototype is the foundation for the actual Developer REST API implementation in GemFire, currently in the...

com.gemstone.gemfire.rest

package.
